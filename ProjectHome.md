Yac2Roku send caller ID info to a Roku device,
this was my first attempt in programming, I learn VB from the ground and it was a very satisfying experience.

Yac2Roku is a YAC Caller ID listener, you have to setup where in the network is the YAC Server (probably in localhost). Then Yac2Roku uses UPNP to determine your roku's IP address.

It has few configuration options like the way it display the info, but actually is a very simple software.

It is in VB, but I hope to translate it to c# some day, if no one do it first.
